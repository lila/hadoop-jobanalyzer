Job_history analyzer for hadoop

Figuring out what's going on in a hadoop job is really a black art.  The job website gives some information,
but the job history log provides a more complete picture of what's going on.  This software parses the job
history and produces summary statistics and tables that you can easily plot for a better understanding
of what your job's execution.

The original version was from
     http://cs.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Hadoop_Tutorial_1.1_--_Generating_Task_Timelines
and i think he got it from one of the Yahoo guys.  That was in python and produces a summary of number of
jobs by type over time.  Sriram Krishnan modified that script a bit.  It's definitely useful and is included here.

But i've been rewriting the script in groovy (aka java) mostly because i can't keep my indentations straight
and adding additional features.

To use:

   % job_history -i <url or path of logfile> [-d <optional delimiter>] [-s | -m | -r ]

the output:

   for -s (summary statistics)
